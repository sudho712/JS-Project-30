# Project 30: JavaScript Drag and Drop

This project demonstrates how to implement drag-and-drop functionality using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user can drag items from one container and drop them into another.

## Features
- **Drag and Drop**: Users can drag elements from the left container to the right container and vice versa.
- **Interactive UI**: The UI includes draggable list items with accompanying icons.
- **Modern JavaScript**: The project utilizes `addEventListener` for handling drag events and modifying the DOM dynamically.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For the structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: For styling the containers and elements.
- **JavaScript**: For handling drag-and-drop functionality.

## Files
1. `index.html`: The main HTML file with two containers, one on the left and one on the right.
2. `styles.css`: The CSS file that styles the containers and list items.
3. `icon.png`: Icon used alongside the list items.
4. `README.md`: This documentation file.
5. `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript code to handle the drag-and-drop logic.
